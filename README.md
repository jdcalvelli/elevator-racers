# elevator-racers

A playful intervention built for the course "Game Design I" during the first year of the New York University Game Center MFA Program. 
The installation took place at the NYU Tandon Engineering building for a week, where elevator riders could vote on which elevator would arrive to pick them up first, and then the results of prior rider votes.
